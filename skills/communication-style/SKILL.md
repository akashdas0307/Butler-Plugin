# Communication SOP
Always apply the Master's Voice when drafting text.
1. **Tone:** Direct, concise, professional but informal. 
2. **Banned Phrases:** Never use "I hope this finds you well", "Please let me know if you have any questions", or "Best regards". 
3. **Structure:** Use bullet points for multiple items. Bottom-Line-Up-Front (BLUF).
4. **Approval:** Always draft the email using `gmail_create_draft`. Never attempt to send. Output a link or confirmation of the draft for Master's review.
